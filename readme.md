# Technical Support

## Why do you think you'd be a good fit for the support role?

_**tl;dr** - I'm a good fit because I love working with developers, I know the tools and use them daily, and relate to people better than I code._

The best part of learning to code has been my peers. Engineers are funny, witty, deep, and curious people. I love working with those people and those people use Github. Programming is my fifth career. Before writing code, I spent 17 years in small business as a business owner, art director, sale rep, and graphic designer. I'm formally trained with a Masters in Finance. In 2008 I began to realize the Internet was here to stay so I started learning to code. I sold my t-shirt business in 2012, went to [starter league](http://www.starterleague.com) and have been coding ever since.

I also obsess over figuring out ways to communicate complicated topics as simple as possible. For example, in light of the challenges in the Daily Deals business, I wrote a 34 page [vision document](/vision_document.pdf) for livingSocial's in an effort to propose new ideas for the company's future.

My Customer service experience comes in 3 forms;

- As a **business owner**, I managed sales and customer happiness for four years.  I once had to deal with a 12,000 piece t-shirt order for a children's security uniform that went missing during shipping. Not a big deal because it happened on the same day that my house was robbed and my first son was born! (_true story_)

- As a **developer on CS internal tools**, I know what it's like to be work with customer service reps who are serving customers directly.

- I waited tables through college and that is the ultimate form of service. :beers:

## What interests you about working in support at GitHub?

The opportunity to work with the many talented individuals at Github would allow me to help developers in an area that I can excel in because I already use Github everyday (personally and professionally). 

Additionally, the chance to work with the Github staff as I continue learning to code in my spare time would ensure I grow as a developer.

Lastly, Github as an organization is one that I so admire that I'm willing to join the team in whatever the team needs help.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I did not have the opportunity to work with [Nathan Whitmer](https://github.com/zerowidth) while he was at livingSocial but I've had beers with him. I've chatted with [Tim Pease](https://github.com/TwP) at many Boulder meetups, code & coffees, and conferences. I used to sell Joel Glovier t-shirts before he worked at Github and I keep tabs on his many [creative uses of Github](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs). Oddly, Matt Yoho interviewed me at livingSocial and we hit it off at Rocky Mtn Ruby over a discussion about comics. He recently merged some of [my PR's for one of his gems](https://github.com/mattyoho/basic_assumption/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Awoodall).  So, hopefully someone over there has something nice to say about me :thought:

## Worth mentioning...

_Could effortlessly explain how Git works to a non-developer_

**Git** is like your Mac's _time machine_ that backs everything up. 
**Github** makes the tools for people to explore the code that the _time machine_ saved.
