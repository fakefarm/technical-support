# About

This is one way to write an about page. What if I needed a template for me and my other code friends? Could I then create a marketing page like mm.wwwoodall.com?

I've been building my own page for a while and I think one benefit to multi-page views (or apps) is they give the individual the chance to digest your information if they're interested.
