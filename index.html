Nothing says 'celebrate' like chocolate and liquor! :-D </i> </p> <p> Correcting an out of sync branch is a two-step fix. First, get the latest code from master. This assumes <code>master</code> is pointed to technoweenie's branch </p> <pre>
            <code>
$ git pull origin master
            </code>
          </pre> <p> Then, </p> <pre>
          <code>
$ git rebase -i origin/master
          </code>
        </pre> <p> Rebasing is the term for adding your code to the most recent <code>master</code>. The <code>-i</code> means <i>interactive</i> so you can squash commits into one, which is what is typically preferred. </p> <p> There's a great post titled <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/" title="">about git rebase</a> that covers a lot of this.

If you remove the collaborator from your private repo, this <a href="https://github.com/blog/2034-greater-control-over-forks-of-your-private-repositories" title="">will also remove the collaborator's fork</a> <i>However, that is really for situations where the collaborator no longer works on the project.</i></p> <p>Regarding;</p> <p> <i> Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? </i> </p> <p>Great question!

When it came time to purchase a car this last time I decided it would be worth the extra money to buy from Carmax as opposed to Ebay, Craigslist, or independet car lot. The service at Carmax because of their service and promise that every car on their lot underwent a 171 checkpoint. Then, they even assured me that anything that breaks in the first 30 days would be replaced for no charge. The vehicle I purchased ended up needing some repairs which they replaced for free. </p> <h2>Tell us about a time where you helped someone.</h2> <p> As a business owner, I managed sales and customer happiness for four years. I once had to deal with a 12,000 piece t-shirt order for a children's security uniform that went missing during shipping. Not a big deal because it happened on the same day that my house was robbed and my first son was born! (true story) </p> <p> Northpoint church is a massive hub of kids and volunteers. they get shirts and they bought the shirts from me and they went missing so while i was in the hospital of my firstborn son when i was explaining to the freight company that they were going to pay $5,000 to cover the boxes they lost. The interesting part is the timing of this fiasco. Because when I went home to get my wife more clothes at the hospital, I came home to discover that my house had been robbed. 'Hmm..' I though, 'I wonder who borrowed my Plasma TV and forgot to shut the front door on the way out'. </p> <h2>What appeals to you about GitHub, as a company you'd potentially be working for?</h2> <p> I think this is a trick question but I will go ahead and answer anyway. The top developers of the top shops work at Github. And those are only the people I am aware of at github. But Github is an instution of greatness because we manage the beast that is eating the world. </p> <p> The opportunity to work with the many talented individuals at Github would allow me to help developers in an area that I can excel in because I already use Github everyday (personally and professionally). </p> <p> Additionally, the chance to work with the Github staff as I continue learning to code in my spare time would ensure I grow as a developer. </p> <p> Lastly, Github as an organization is one that I so admire that I'm willing to join the team in whatever the team needs help. </p> <h2>How would you describe what GitHub does to a non-technical person?</h2> <p> Github is built on git, which is like a Mac's time machine that backs everything up. Github makes the tools for people to interact with the current and previous versions of code that was 'saved'. </p> <h2>What motivates you to work in support?</h2> <p>I love answering questions because it means I have the opportunity to share my knowledge or learn something new by helping someone else. Support is filled with questions and I have an appreciation for people who take time to articulate their situation into a question.</p> </div> </section> </section> <script>
