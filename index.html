I am surprised that the system did not notify me if it was okay to grant the fork permission. Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? Also, other than asking the collaborator to delete the forked repo, can I actually delete it?</p> <p>Thanks, jamestk</p> </div> </div> <div class=image> <img src="images/tall.jpg"/> </div> <div class=copy> <hr> <div class=response> <p>James, </p> Collaborators have the ability to fork repos they contribute to since <p>forking is a key component to team collaboration. If you remove the collaborator from your private repo, this <a href="https://github.com/blog/2034-greater-control-over-forks-of-your-private-repositories" title="">will also remove the collaborator's fork</a> <i>However, that is really for situations where the collaborator no longer works on the project.</i></p> <p>Regarding;</p> <p> <i> Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? </i> </p> <p>Great question! Any new private repo you create begins with only yourself. 'Permissions' are a topic of team management. Here are two resources for help with that:</p> <p>1. Intro to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-teams/" title="">setting up teams</a>.</p> <p>2.

You might find this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" title=forking>page about forking</a> helpful to get a better idea how the relationship works.</p> <p>I'm here if you get stuck!</p> <p>-- </p> <p>Dave Woodall</p> <p>tech support</p> <p><b>helpful resources</b></p> <p> <a href="https://help.github.com " title=""> help.github.com </a> </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/contact" title=""> submit a new ticket </a> </p> <p> Discover <a href="https://github.com/explore" title="">interesting</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trending" title="">trending</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/showcases" title="">popular</a> open source projects </p> </div> </section> </section> <section class='l-container content'> <div id=five></div> <span id=about></span> <section class='module about'> <h1>Accounts Mgmt</h1> <div class=image> <img src="images/animores/fly.jpg"/> </div> <div class=copy> <div class=customer_email> <h2Need to get my account back</h2> <h2>Need to get my account back</h2> <p>Hi, my name is Jorge,</p> <p>I'm the CTO of JorgeLLC.

One time I bought an SUV and it caught on fire six days later. After five of these kinds of fiascos I decided to stop looking for a good deal and start looking for a good seller. </p> <p> I chose Carmax because every car on the lot must pass a 125 point checklist and if anything breaks in the first 30 days they replace it at no charge. Sure enough, two weeks after owning my new vehicle the fuel pump broke. Carmax quickly replaced it and won a customer for life because their service was empathetic, prompt, and effective. </p> <h2>Tell us about a time where you helped someone.</h2> <p> I used to sell t-shirts for a living. One order was for 1,200 SECURITY volunteers at a children's concert. The order was completed and in transit as my wife went into labor with our first son. We went into the hospital on Monday with the order scheduled to deliver on Tuesday and distrusted to volunteers Thursday, for the Saturday event. </p> <p> At the hospital I received a call from the freight company that the shirts had been lost in transit. Rather than cuddle with my newborn son, I spent those first hours figuring out how to get shirts replaced and delivered in 3 days. </p> <p> The solution I negotiated was for the freight company cover the replacement and rush shipping costs so that innocent children can enjoy their concert in peace. </p> <h2>What appeals to you about GitHub, as a company you'd potentially be working for?</h2> <p> Software is eating the world and GitHub manages that software. GitHub is a magnet for the kinds of people, projects, and lifestyle I aspire to be surrounded by professionally and personally. </p> <p> Additionally, I expect to collaborate with the design and engineering staff on a regular basis for customer suggestions and improvements. Such interactions would surely positively influence my own progress toward becoming a senior developer. </p> <h2>How would you describe what GitHub does to a non-technical person?</h2> <p> <b>me:</b> <i>"We're like Facebook for coders."</i> </p> <p> <b>inquirer:</b> (sips cocktail) <i>"How so?"</i> </p> <p> <b>me:</b> <i>"We make social tools for people to code together. Like sharing and commenting about code."</i> </p> <p> <b>inquirer:</b> (takes a sip) <i>"hmm.. I think there are nachos over there."</i> <p> <b>me:</b> <i>"But I didn't tell you my fork joke yet?"</i> </p> </p> <h2>What motivates you to work in support?</h2> <p> I work with git and GitHub everyday. The opportunity to help developers in an area that I know well would provide me a great sense of daily, professional satisfaction. Personally, I enjoy answering questions because it means I have the chance to share my knowledge or learn something new by helping someone else. I also have an appreciation for people who take time to articulate their situation into a question because that's the hard part :-) </p> </div> </section> </section> <script>
